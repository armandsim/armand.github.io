**[Selection and Behavioral Responses of Health Insurance Subsidies in the Long Run: Evidence from a Field Experiment in Ghana](/docs/AKS_Ghana_Published_Version_HE.pdf)** with Patrick Asuming and Hyuncheol Bryant Kim 
*Health Economics, 2024, 33(5): 992–1032.* <br>

<div class="abstract-content">
We study the effects of a health insurance subsidy in Ghana, where mandates are not enforceable. We randomly provide different levels of subsidy (1/3, 2/3, and full) and evaluate the impact at seven months and three years after the intervention. We find that a one-time subsidy increased insurance enrollment for all groups in both the short and long runs, but health care utilization in the long run increased only for the partial subsidy group. We find supportive evidence that ex-post behavioral responses rather than ex-ante selective enrollment explain the long-run health care utilization results.

**[Addressing Vaccine Hesitancy using Local Ambassadors: A Randomized Controlled Trial in Indonesia](/docs/Vaccine_EER.pdf)** with Asad Islam, Gita Kusnadi, Jahen Rezki, Giovanni van Empel, Michael Vlassopoulos, and Yves Zenou *European Economic Review, 2024, 163, 104683* <br>

<div class="abstract-content">
In settings where resistance and rampant misinformation against vaccines exist, the prospect of containing infectious diseases remains a challenge. Can delivery of information regarding the benefits of vaccination through personal home visits by local ambassadors increase vaccine uptake? We conduct a door-to-door randomized information campaign targeted towards COVID-19 unvaccinated individuals in rural Indonesia. We recruited ambassadors from local villages tasked to deliver information about COVID-19 vaccines and promote vaccination through one-on-one meetings, using an interpersonal behavioral change communication approach. To investigate which type of ambassador—health cadres, influential individuals, and laypersons—is the most effective, we randomly vary the type of ambassador that delivers the information at the village level. We find that the overall vaccination take-up is quite moderate and that there are no differences in vaccination outcomes across the treatment groups. These results highlight the challenge of boosting vaccine uptake in late stages of a pandemic.

**[The Consequences of Child Market Work on the Growth of Human Capital](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0305750X15308731?via%3Dihub)** with Asep Suryahadi and Daniel Suryadarma *World Development, 2017, 91: 144–155.* <br>

<div class="abstract-content">
The paper measures the effect of child market work on the long-term growth of human capital, focusing on the output of the human capital production: mathematics skills, cognitive skills, pulmonary function, and educational attainment. Our full sample is drawn from a rich longitudinal dataset Indonesia Family Life Survey (IFLS). We address endogeneity of child market work using provincial legislated minimum wage as the instrument. Our instrumental variable estimation shows that child labor negatively affects mathematics skills and pulmonary function, but not cognitive skills and educational attainment. We find heterogeneities in type of work. Those who work outside of family business have lower educational attainment than those working for family business.

**[Sink or Swim: Testing the Role of Science vs Religion in Raising Environmental Awareness in Indonesia](/docs/jakarta_draft.pdf)** with Sarah Gultom, Umair Khalil, Wang Lee, Alyas Widita <br>

<div class="abstract-content">
Shifting beliefs and encouraging pro-sustainability behaviors to mitigate climate and environmental issues can be challenging due to their polarizing nature. This challenge is particularly concerning in Jakarta, the world's fastest sinking city, where many residents remain uninformed about land subsidence—its causes, severity, and implications. Through a large-scale online experiment, we examine how information source identity (represented by an actor portraying a religious leader or scientist), narrative style of an environmental video message (religious vs. scientific), and their interaction influence beliefs and attitudes regarding this environmental threat. Our results show that exposure to any version of the environmental message significantly shifts participants' beliefs, enhances both self-efficacy and institutional trust, and increases willingness to adopt pro-sustainability behaviors, suggesting promising pathways for public engagement. The largest impacts on beliefs emerge when a scientist—perceived as more persuasive and trustworthy than an Imam—delivers the message, regardless of narrative style. A scientist delivering religious narrative is particularly effective at encouraging participants to spread awareness about the root cause of subsidence, while an Imam shows more consistent impact at building trust across stakeholders. The effects on beliefs are more pronounced among individuals with low prior knowledge, high trust in institutions, and less reliance on groundwater for drinking. However, even among those least informed, we find limited evidence of heterogeneous treatment effects on actions. Our findings highlight how the interplay between messenger perceived credibility and narrative framing shapes public understanding and action on environmental challenges.

**Unlocking Immunity: Strategies for Cost-Effective Promotion of COVID-19 Vaccination in Developing Countries** with Asad Islam, Hyuncheol Bryant Kim, and Deb Prakashi, *Revise and resubmit, Journal of Health Economics* <br>

<div class="abstract-content">
Encouraging COVID-19 vaccination among hesitant individuals is vital for achieving herd immunity and curbing the spread of the virus. We conducted a large-scale randomized experiment in India to evaluate five interventions targeting individuals that remained unvaccinated after the initial mass vaccination campaign: (i) information only; (ii) information plus a gift worth $5 upon vaccination; (iii) information plus a 5% chance to win a gift worth $100 upon vaccination; (iv) information combined with improved vaccine accessibility; (v) information disseminated through community leaders. While all interventions successfully increased vaccination rates, information combined with non-cash incentives and improved accessibility have higher impacts on first-dose uptake compared to the information campaign alone. Information delivery through local community leaders was the most effective intervention in encouraging completion of the full vaccination schedule.
